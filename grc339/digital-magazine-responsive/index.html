                                <p>
                                    With a rich and deep background of artistic references, and being interested in galleries and museums since she was a child, Arielle captures the world in an unconventional way, proving that a drab and gray reality can be turned into a world full of winks to color. Not only the garments and the poses, but also the environment where the shoot takes place, shape all together a playful scene. We talk with her to deepen in what happens when one is so young and talented and has so much in her head to tell.

                                    Ask anyone in the know for a list of rising stars in the Korean fashion scene and they’ll mention Cho Gi-Seok. With over 300k people — including magazine editors, stylists, celebrities, and luxury brand designers — currently following the photographer’s every move on Instagram, it is clear that his reach extends way beyond Korean borders. Another border the 29-year-old artist freely crosses is the one between art and commerce. Consistently creating original, boundary-pushing work, Cho continues to be a unique reference for others in the industry too. Yet, he is far from complacent.

                                <p>
                                    Jon Henry's new photography book, Stranger Fruit, has an obvious reference point in its title: the timelessly chilling, evocative song Strange Fruit, first written in 1937 but most famous through the voice of Billy Holiday with her 1939 recording and live renditions. The song became a powerful beacon within the civil rights movement. The decision to reference it in this photography series is deliberate, given its themes of Black motherhood and manhood.  Born in Queens, New York, and now based in Brooklyn, Henry is a visual artist working with photography and text whose work examines themes such as family, sociopolitical issues, grief, trauma and healing within the African American community. Henry has become known for making images inherently imbued with a sense of cultural activism, and this new body of work is no exception.

                                <p>  
                                Like many budding photographers, Kyle Jeffers’ first camera was his phone. “I was at elementary school, filming skateboarding videos in the driveway,” he remembers. Jeffers was raised in Toronto, where the “ominous and bold” abandoned industrial buildings and smooth, wide roads created dynamic backdrops for his shoots. “I would film as we explored. This developed into photography, and eventually into a career.”

                                <p>
                                I'm a 22-year-old French-Ukrainian photographer – born in Kyiv and based in Paris. Every August, I go through the same ritual: I pack my suitcase, spend three hours on a plane, and then I’m home. But this year was a little different: There were no planes to Ukraine. The only option to go home was taking a bus with stopovers in bordering countries, and it was incredibly hard to secure a spot. It seemed like everyone was trying to do the same thing - go home, see family and look for loved ones who’d stayed behind.

                                <p>
                                    Described by Helin as a "photographic experiment", Relativity: Matching with La Muralla Roja blurs the boundaries between photography, staging and performance. Captured in the stunning buildings of the Red Wall - a vibrant, Brutalist apartment complex located on Spain's eastern coast built by the late Catalan architect Ricardo Bofill Levi – the images see Helin adapt to the striking and formidable concrete shapes with her body. Unsurprisingly, the buildings themselves provided the initial inspiration for the series. Jutting out of the coast in dramatic contrast to the surrounding blues of the sea and sky, the residential complex of La Muralla Roja boasts monumental geometry, which is influenced by Greek cross typology elements and the kasbah walls lifted from Arab Mediterranean tradition.

                            <p>
                                The origin story of Hysterical is a friendship fairy tale for the digital age: creators Bee Illustrates and Eliza Hatch fostered a friendship online, navigating their growing social media platforms as queer, feminist creators. When they met by accident at a post-pandemic IRL event in October 2021, they knew they were destined to be more than just friends: they were the perfect match as creative collaborators. Five months later, they launched Hysterical, a charity group exhibition celebrating the work of women and marginalised genders using their creative practice as a form of protest. It's now back for a second year, featuring a brand new lineup of artworks and events and supporting a fresh set of charities: Glitch, which supports victims of online abuse and The Outside Project, supporting unhoused LGBTIQ+ youth.

                              <p>
                                “I’ve always wanted things to sit in the same world,” Gabriel Moses says, “I see a photo and I almost want the video to look like a moving photo.” In this interview, Moses discusses his career to date and the ideas behind his debut exhibition at London’s 180 Studios, Regina, which combines photography, film and sculpture. Regina features around 50 photographs from Moses’ career across fashion, music and sport, including never-before-seen images. The exhibition also includes the premiere of two new short films, including Ijó, commissioned by 180 Studios, that follows a group of young ballet dancers in Lagos, Nigeria. The second film shares its name with exhibition itself. “Essentially it’s my mind in the film,” Moses says. “It’s the things I see as beautiful, it’s moments I wanted to put on screen.”

                                <p>
                                    Joe Puxley is a 21-year-old British photographer based in Brighton. An alumnus of the BRIT School, Joe's portoflio already boasts features in publications such as Vogue Italia, The British Journal Of Photography, DAZED, Wonderland, Notion, The Face and CLASH. Having photographed artists such as Arlo Parks, Erykah Badu, Gregory Porter, Tom Misch, Loyle Carner, Desta French and Pa Salieu, Joe is certainly making a name for himself very quickly. Escapism is an important theme in his work as he strives to create a vibrant ontology of youth through his photography and an approach that offers an alternative perspective. Outside of photography, Joe is also an avid filmmaker. We spoke to Joe about his artistic approaches, influences and advice to budding photographers.

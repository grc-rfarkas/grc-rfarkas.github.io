                                <p>
                                    With a rich and deep background of artistic references,
                                    and being interested in galleries and museums since 
                                    she was a child, Arielle captures the world in an 
                                    unconventional way, proving that a drab and gray 
                                    reality can be turned into a world full of winks to 
                                    color. Not only the garments and the poses, but 
                                    also the environment where the shoot takes place, 
                                    shape all together a playful scene. We talk with 
                                    her to deepen in what happens when one is so young 
                                    and talented and has so much in her head to tell.

                                Jeffers was raised in Toronto, where the “ominous and bold” abandoned industrial buildings and smooth, wide roads created dynamic backdrops for his shoots. “I would film as we explored. This developed into photography, and eventually into a career.”

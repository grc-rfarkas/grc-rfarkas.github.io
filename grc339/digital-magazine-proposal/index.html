            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            
            <h3>JINX </h3>
            
            <p>I am planning to digitize my GRC 440 magazine, JINX. I envision my magazine serving as a collection of inspiration for young professional artists. I want the photography and copy to allow artists to build a community and feel supported during their journey exploring a creative career path. This magazine aims to enter the art and creative space, exploring trends within artistitc activism and inspiration. For my magazine, my target audience is individuals between the ages of 20-28 who are immersed in the creative space. I want to target young professional artists and creatives who are pursuing their creative passions within the writing, film, fashion and design industries. I anticipate the annual household income of my readers to be between 60-80k, most likely because most readers are just beginning their professional career and/or are venturing into a more freelance, independent creative position.  </p><!--Short description of the magazine-->

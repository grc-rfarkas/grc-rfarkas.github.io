            <h2> Our Story </h2>
            <p class ="description">Coffee has always been a part of my life and my relationships—but it’s not just me. Communities around the world unite around coffee and coffee houses. Deals are made, relationships are started and forged, creativity flourishes, knowledge grows, and palates are satisfied in coffee houses.
                Silverlake businesses are bucking the trend of shopping malls, chain restaurants and stores, and faceless corporations taking your money out of your local economy. It felt like the perfect place to open a coffee house that was genuinely a part of the community. I have since found that the group of business owners in our little corner of the valley is an amazing group of people who truly care about their teams, customers, and community. I am so honored to be among them.
                But I don't view Evil Eye Coffee as my coffee house. I view Evil Eye Coffee as your coffee house. Without the community, Evil Eye would just be a building with equipment in it. It is not truly a coffee house until it is filled with people, the sound of voices sharing themselves over a cup of coffee, the sound of milk steaming, the smell of freshly ground coffee and warm pastries, and the almost tangible feeling of relationships. Once you experience it, you will know what we are talking about.</p>
                Come into one of our four Evil Eye Coffee locations and be welcomed; sit back, relax, and slow down for a bit. Read a book, play a game, or share a story. We can't wait to see you!</p>
